# Halo Mythic Soldier Equipment

A Foundry VTT module for Mythic that lets GMs instantly outfit NPC tokens—Unggoy, ODST, Jiralhanae and more—with data-driven equipment packs, variant choices and more.

## Features

- **Automatic Type Detection**  
  The macro now reads the soldier type directly from your token’s actor, via the `soldierType` field, so you only pick the equipment pack—no extra dialogs.

- **Streamlined Pack Selection**  
  Choose the pack (e.g. “Anti-Infantry Equipment,” “Spiker Equipment”) and immediately proceed to any variant choices.

- **Variant Choices**  
  When a pack offers multiple options (weapons, harnesses, grenades), the macro pops a single dialog to pick your preferred variant(s).

- **Bulk Creation & Configuration**  
  All selected items are added to the actor at once, with correct quantities, ammo counts, and equipped/carried status.

## Usage

1. **Enable** the “Halo Mythic Soldier Equipment” module in **Settings → Manage Modules**.  
2. **Select** your NPC token on the canvas.  
3. **Execute** the “NPC Equipment Applicator” macro from your hotbar.  
4. **Pick** the equipment pack for this soldier (the macro auto-detected its type).  
5. **Choose** any variants (if prompted).  
6. **Click** Apply—and watch your NPC’s sheet populate instantly.
